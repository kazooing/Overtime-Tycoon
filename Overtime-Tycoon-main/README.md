Welcome to the first party 4 game project: Overtime Tycoon ＼(￣▽￣)／	

things to keep in mind when working on this project:
1. Please name your commits as clear as possible while keeping it not too long, use the https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ naming rule if possible.
2. Don't forget to add a new branch when adding changes to avoid game breaking mistakes
3. Please fill out the mentioned to-do list https://docs.google.com/document/d/13xEHZ_Nl0qS1IbUR-qMIYsPtEOKAh7W_LNHrR7ZzfsA/edit?tab=t.0 before going on to work on a new feature
